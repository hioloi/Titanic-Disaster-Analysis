# Titanic

**Insights about Titanic dataset**

Key Factors Influencing Titanic Passenger Survival:<br>
**Gender**: Women were more likely to survive than men (74.20% vs. 18.89%).<br>
**Class**: First-class passengers had the highest survival rate (62.96%), followed by Second-class passengers (47.28%) and Third-class passengers (24.24%). These results align with expectations, as First-class passengers were generally accommodated on higher decks of the Titanic compared to those in Second and Third-class. Being on higher decks likely provided First-class passengers with more time to access lifeboats and escape when the ship began sinking, increasing their chances of survival.<br>
**Age**: Babies (aged 0 to 5) had the highest survival rate (62.26%), followed by individuals aged 31 to 60, with a survival rate of approximately 40.28%.<br>
**Family Size**: Passengers with 3 relatives on board had the highest survival rate (72.41%), followed by passengers with 2 relatives (57.84%) and those with 1 relative (55.28%).<br>
**Fare**: Passengers who paid higher fares (above the 75th percentile) had a survival rate of 58.11%, while those who paid fares up to the 75th percentile had a survival rate of 44.54%. Passengers who paid lower fares experienced a significantly higher death rate.
